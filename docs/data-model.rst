Data Model
==========

.. include:: _include.rst

This section serves to describe the relationships between the various
components in an |Artifact|. It seeks to present an explicit set of named
resource types and how they relate to one another.

This data model seeks to identify explicitly any implicit relationships and to
add semantic color to these. It is a work in progress and likely to be
incomplete and/or wrong.

Projects and Named Resources
----------------------------

Certain resources are *named*, meaning that these entities may be referenced
by user-defined semantic identifiers. Since Truffle targets the full development
lifecycle, this means names refer to different things at different times.

|Contracts| and |Networks|, for example, both use names. These resources
represent entities that change over time. Contracts are written, rewritten,
and/or updated many times between a project's start and past its production
deployment. Development networks reset, and public networks fork.

To represent these entities across the entire project lifecycle, Truffle DB
models names as a linked list of references to immutable entities.

Each Named resource contains the non-nullable string attribute ``name``, used
to index by type.

**NameRecord** can be considered generically to represent a linked list of
current and past resource name references for a given resource type ``T``.
Each NameRecord has the same ``name``, plus the following:
- ``type`` to represent the underlying named resource type
- ``resource`` to point to the underlying resource
- ``previous`` to point to the previous name

In order to track the current NameRecords for a given type, the **Project**
resource serves as the aggregation point for the heads of these linked lists.

Contract Interfaces

Contract Interfaces have not been implemented in the first version of Truffle DB, but will be added in a future iteration.

Network
```````

.. uml::

  scale 0.75

  !define SHOW_NETWORK
  !define SHOW_NETWORK_INTERNAL

  !include uml/macros.iuml


A network resource comprises a friendly name, a network ID, and a known historic
block.
